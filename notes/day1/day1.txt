    * data representations - binary, hexadecimal, 2's complement, endianness
    * computer model       - cpu, memory, registers, compilers, linkers
    * x86 architecture     - x86, x86-64, assembly, stack, heap, memory layout
    * examining binaries   - strings, readelf, objdump, symbols, sections, segments, got, plt
    * gdb                  - help, disassemble, break, run, x, display, etc.
